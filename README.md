# Web Portfolio Using React

Hi this is the link to my portfolio: https://longnguyen1112.github.io/long_portfolio/.   
I just think that I need to reinforce my knowledge of Front-end (CSS and Javascript) and practice more on React by creating a web portfolio for myself.

# This project is to learn and practice on:
JavaScript and CSS.   
Update new CSS transition      
Using EmailJS for email service in Contact Section.   
Using Context API to create a toggle for Dark Mode.   
Create a responsive design for phone view by media query  .   
It will be hosted on GitHub.    

# Here are the example capture from website:
